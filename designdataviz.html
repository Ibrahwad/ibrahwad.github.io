            <p class="text-copy">When working at Drop, I had a period where I specifically focused on data visualization. During this period of time, I had to distill complex data into something snack-sized and understandable. I was tasked with helping create reports using credit/debit spend and survey data that told the story of the economy during COVID-19. If you're interested in delving deeper into that experience, you can learn more here. However, this piece will focus on what I have learned about data visualization during that time and some of the common design pitfalls.<br><br>As Product Designers, we tend to include data within our every decision. However, one of the areas that we might easily overlook is the format we provide data to our users. For example, on Dribbble, for every new sleek dashboard there is one that is flagged with usability issues or data visualization errors. <br><br>Data itself should be used to clearly deliver information to the end user. Understanding what the user might think, as well as optimizing to make that information more deliverable provides a better experience. In this piece, I go through my thought process and provide commentary on data types as well as questions to ask yourself in the process of working with data visualization. This piece will primarily focus on graphs, but I'll also touch on related concepts.
            </p>

                
            <div class="chart-holder1 content-hugging">
                <p class="title-copy" style="font-size: 24px; opacity: 75%;" id="a2">What Question Am I Answering?</p>
            </div>



                    <p class="text-copy">One of the first primary things to do when ideating on data visualization is to understand what is the question. The value of data itself is the insights you can drive from it, and those insights tend to answer questions. For an investment app, one of the main questions might be “How am I performing?”, which is relatively straightforward. Provide a piece that showcases delta between t1 and t2. For this you can create a line-chart or area chart that shows performance.<br><br>However, for something like a Cloud Storage Management tool, the customer's question might be “What are the costs, and how can we reduce them and improve performance”. This being a multidimensional question, you’d require various different data pieces. As you can understand this would then impact your method or the tools you then choose for the job. Answering those questions would require a combination of different visualization methods.<br><br>A way to think about something like this would be to first identify that question you are looking to answer in that data. Then begin to question the scope, what are the boundaries and how much data are we looking to include. In this process you will be working on refining your research question, similarly to refining a product requirement document. A more research based example would be looking at something like “What is the impact of remote work on employee productivity”. Defining the scope of the question, would be understanding the bounds of this, such as does this cover all types of remote work? Are there specific industries or job roles being targeted? This would also be a place to do preliminary research on the sourcing of the data, ensuring you can get the data you need.In this situation you might find yourself overwhelmed or lacking data, the latter being more detrimental to your output as the former can be refined. Furthermore, understanding the relevance of this piece of data for your user and the value it brings will help you better crystalize and understand where to take the visualization.</p>

            
                    <div class="chart-holder1 content-hugging"><p class="title-copy" style="font-size: 24px; opacity: 75%;" id="a3">How to choose a tool & method</p></div>

                    <p class="text-copy">As mentioned similarly to the design process, we have to understand what the type of data we’re using is and the users end goal. For different types of data, there are specific tools that better highlight your message. You must be deliberate with the tool you are using to show the data. For example, for the comparison of revenue of a single entity over a time span (time-series data with 1 individual), a bar chart might solve the problem. The user would likely be able to come away with the takeaway relatively quickly. As shown in the example here, they would see revenue peaking in 2022, and a relative pullback in 2023.</p>

                    <div class="chart-holder2 content-hugging">
                        <p class="figure-heading" style="font-weight: 700;">Mock Data: Widget Industry Revenue/Year</p>
                        <canvas id="Chart2"></canvas>
                    </div>

                    <p class="text-copy">If we were to expand this data set to be based on months, you would get a better pulse as well. As you'd be able to identify specific monthly revenue gaps. If you were the owner of the business, you would be able to take that insight and apply it. Potentially attempting to remedy that problem by asking of the question of why does this occur.</p>

                    <div class="chart-holder2 content-hugging">
                        <p class="figure-heading" style="font-weight: 700;">Mock Data: Widget Industry Revenue/Month</p>
                        <canvas id="Chart6"></canvas>
                    </div>

                    <p class="text-copy">However, if we then increase the number of entities in this universe, we begin to see a problem. Furthermore this also potentially obfuscates small changes due to the scale and the y-axis. If the question is “How is our company doing vs. others”. You can get an idea of the comparison of discrete categories, but less of an idea of the ongoing trend.</p>

                    <div class="chart-holder2 content-hugging">
                        <p class="figure-heading" style="font-weight: 700;">Mock Data: Yearly Widget Sales by Company ($M)</p>
                        <canvas id="chart3"></canvas>
                    </div>

                    <p class="text-copy">This piece of data visualization could be improved by thinking about other tools available. Such as other formats of charts that better convey the data and answer the question. As you expand the scope, other formats begin to show more benefit. For example, a bar chart works perfectly well for observing 1 entity. However, it begins to struggle when the number increases. In this situation a line-chart might benefit, but keep in mind the larger in scope, the more difficult it is for your charts to convey data effectively. As you will need to be even more deliberate in your choice.</p>

                </div>

                <p class="text-copy">In this section, you can take a bit of time to focus on data. One of the main things we’ve looked at is the question we’re looking to answer. For example, the mock data we’ve been using so far has been as so. Assuming these are the only 4 entities in the industry.</p>

                <div class="chart-holder2 content-hugging">
                    <p class="figure-heading" style="font-weight: 700;">Percentage Graph</p>
                    <div id="tableContainer"></div>
                </div>

                <p class="text-copy">This has been just looking at specific flat yearly revenue numbers, however, if our question was focusing on “Distribution of Revenue”, we could slice or modify the data to understand that. By using a simple function to convert these into percentages and find their value compared to the full sum of a year.</p>

                <div class="chart-holder2 content-hugging">
                    <p class="figure-heading" style="font-weight: 700;">Mock Data: Distribution of Yearly Revenue by Country</p>
                    <div id="percentageTableContainer"></div>
                </div>

                <p class="text-copy">When looking at this data, we need a method that provides context to the user. Showing them the total industry, as well as the total sum of each entity. We can try out an initial stacked chart to identify any trends. </p>

                <div class="chart-holder2 content-hugging">
                    <p class="figure-heading" style="font-weight: 700;">Mock Data:  Distribution of Yearly Revenue by Country (%)</p>
                    <canvas id="stackedbar"></canvas>
                </div>

                <p class="text-copy">However, a limitation of this graph might be its inability to let individuals clearly see trends across the period. Although, choosing an area graph might allow you to see those trends more clearly.</p>

                <div class="chart-holder2 content-hugging">
                    <p class="figure-heading" style="font-weight: 700;">Mock Data: Distribution of Yearly Revenue by Country (%)</p>
                    <canvas id="areaChart"></canvas>
                </div>

                <p class="text-copy">When looking at the area graph, you’re more able to clearly see the trends. As it removes the margins and clearly provides an excess. In most coded data visualization methods, this would just be a stacked modification of a line chart with fill. In my case, the only difference between this and a line graph would be the stacked:true modifier.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, don’t be afraid to slice the data a bit more to find more data you can potentially use. For example, with these charts so far such as Figure XX. You might have noticed the dip in 2021 for this mock data set. Don’t be afraid to return to your old data set and slice it to figure out new insights. For example, by looking at the growth rate of revenue you might be able to clarify insights</p>

                 </div>

                    <p class="text-copy">When working through data visualization, one should always pay attention to the tools available to them in their environment. It is crucial, if you are aiming to create a mock for a dashboard, specifically understanding how the data itself is funneled or the tools available to your development team. We can create leverage tools such as Figma or XD to create a beautiful dash mockup from scratch. However, we should always keep in mind stakeholder requirements as well as how we’ll go about handing off the design for development. <br><br>By familiarizing yourself with the tools your team will use to complete the task, you can better prepare a product solution. Are you designing with D3.js, Chart.js, or another library in mind? Aligning your design decisions with the technical realities ensures a smoother handoff to the development team. Aligning your design decisions with the technical realities ensures a smoother handoff to the development team <br><br>Furthermore, your environment also includes the data being ingested. If your solution requires a new data configuration, really weigh out the cost benefits and investigate before going ahead. As you might be able to come up with more efficient solutions under constraints, such as a Cron job updating the tables every so often to save on potential system costs versus real time updates (depending on the time sensitivity of the data). Real-time and instant updates are great, but in Product Design, the idea would be to find an optimal balance between aesthetic appeal, functionality, system efficiency as well as business requirements.
