                    <p class="text-copy">Initially diving into the quantitative data, such as daily active users & user retention. We had noticed areas of improvement for the product and wanted to understand exactly what the user would suggest and gather data. This quantitative data allowed us to explore and define the problem space. Furthermore, when you combine quantitative research data it allows you to measure and validate that defined problem. In this case, for what reasons does a user complete a survey, do they run into many problems or unknowns? do they see different experiences based on user flow? Showing the different questions needed to be answered<br><br>As we had loads of quantitative data, this study would be lacking on qualitative data to ask questions that may indicate as to why certain behaviors were occurring. To draw in more insight, tying in qualitative data found through customer support tickets allowed me to tighten up the methodology and directly ask about specific pain points.<br><br>By organizing both the qualitative data via Looker & SQL and combining the qualitative data found via customer support tickets I was able to draft a fairly conclusive survey to address both the user & the business' concerns. The survey itself had a focus on understanding user behavior as well as areas for improvement. Alongside this the survey was drafted with Likert methodology to allow operationalization of behavioral traits. Furthermore out of this draft emerged a separate case study to identify behavior on competitive applications, as our highest value cohort had a statistically significant chance to use other platforms.</p>

                    <p class="text-copy">After building a draft and reviewing it alongside stakeholders, it was time to execute upon the plan for this survey. For the choice of survey provider, Qualtrics was the go to, as we had created multiple choice questions rooted in the initial evidence to understand what exactly the users thought. Qualtrics provides a relatively easy to use and easy to implement API to launch directly on an application.<br><br>Furthermore to better segment the data, I had used different audience groups as different personas require different needs. To do this I had segmented the audience by those who frequently use the product and those outside of this group. This was done through Looker & SQL to analyze the different cohorts. This allowed me to segment a separate analysis for churned, active and new users. As each different user persona had different distinct problems</p>

                <p class="text-copy">As the data began to come in for the different cohorts, reviewing the different pain points and disseminating it to stakeholders would be the next steps. I segmented the data via the metrics where there was impact as well as included the option for those more statistically fluent to review the data via excel or SPSS. As there was over 2000 responses in both a text & multiple choice format, alongside manual review of text-entry I had used sentiment analysis provided by Qualtrics to better categorize the groups of users as well as their input and pain points.<br><br>Following this, I had presented the data to the different stakeholders who would find value and impact. Leading to updates on the roadmap as well as changes to how customer support handles different errors or bugs for the product line.</p>

                <p class="text-copy">Following the above, I had designed a solution for onboarding that impacted a specific user journey. This being users new to the platform and looking for information as to how it worked.<br><br>The problem statement for a large portion of the new user cohort would be the following: New users of the application often feel lost on how the different parts of our survey vertical interact. This is a problem because the different streams of our survey product house different products for the end-user with different values. This is also a problem for veteran users as they don't quite know the biggest difference between the featured section & 3rd party section.<br><br>To then address this, we implemented a Survey Education feature. This educating a user with the product itself, by creating a custom survey as an onboarding experience and intuitively showing users exactly how the product splits & works. To this date the addition has been completed by over 150K users, and has been rated highly.</p>
